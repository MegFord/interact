Consider three ways of extolling the virtues of Tai Chi:

(1) Dude, Tai Chi rocks!
(2) Tai chi provides serious health benefits.
(3) Dont u like 2 do tai chi?

The goal is to pick one of those three choices based on information from a user's social media presence.

The general idea is to
1- Cluster a large number of social media users by linguistic style (aka "register"). The output is a list of "style clusters".
2- Assign a new user to one of these style clusters based on the text in their social media feeds.
3- Select a dialog statement based on the selected style cluster.

Alternatively, we may want to take as input a dialog statement, and output similar words that can be substituted to rephrase the statement. This seems harder.
